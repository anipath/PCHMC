# Parsimonious Classification using Higher Order Markov Chains

## Abstract

Classification problems with categorical feature variables can be found in various fields of study like biology, computer science, finance, etc. Our goal is to discuss some parsimonious methodologies that can be used in this context. Here we discuss about three different classifiers. The first one uses maximum likelihood estimates. The second one uses a mixture probability model for the conditional probabilities. And, the last one uses LASSO regularized logistic regression on counting statistics. We prove the weak consistency of the classifier based on maximum likelihood estimates. We apply these classifiers on simulated datasets to assess the performance by their misclassification rates and time efficiency.

* The R files consists the codes for the classfier based on maximum likelihood estimates, mixture probability model and LASSO regularized logistic regression on counting statistics respectively.
